# undaad
A decompiler for games made with DAAD.

Made by Morgul and Uto.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: this decompiler is obsolete, and though it may be useful to decompile
early Aventuras AD games, from the DOS files, it's not the best solution to decompile
a modern DAAD game (included lastest AD games).

In general, you better use unDRC instead:
